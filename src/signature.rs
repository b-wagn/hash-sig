/// Defines the interface for a **synchronized signature scheme**.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// In a synchronized (or stateful) signature scheme, keys are associated with a fixed
/// lifetime, which is divided into discrete time periods called **epochs**. A key pair
/// is restricted to signing only one message per epoch. Reusing an epoch to sign a
/// different message or even the same message again will compromise the security of the scheme.
///
/// This model is particularly well-suited for consensus protocols like Ethereum's
/// proof-of-stake (lean Ethereum), where validators sign messages
/// (e.g., block proposals or attestations) at regular, predetermined intervals.
///
/// ## Theoretical Foundation
///
/// This trait abstracts the family of post-quantum signature schemes presented in
/// "Hash-Based Multi-Signatures for Post-Quantum Ethereum" [DKKW25] and its
/// extension "LeanSig for Post-Quantum Ethereum". These schemes are variants of
/// the **eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS)**, which builds a many-time signature
/// scheme from a one-time signature (OTS) primitive and a Merkle tree.
///
/// The core components are:
/// 1.  **One-Time Signatures**: Each epoch corresponds to a single WOTS-like key pair.
/// 2.  **Merkle Tree**: A Merkle tree is built over all one-time public keys, and its
///     root becomes the main, many-time public key. This provides a commitment to the
///     entire set of one-time keys.
/// 3.  **Incomparable Encoding**: A function that maps a message to a codeword, which
///     in turn determines how the one-time signature is generated. Different encodings
///     provide different trade-offs between signature size and verification cost.
pub trait SignatureScheme {
    /// The public key used for verification. It typically contains the Merkle root
    /// and any public parameters required by the underlying cryptographic primitives
    /// (e.g., for a tweakable hash function).
    ///

    /// * `rng`: A cryptographically secure random number generator.

    /// The signing process may be probabilistic, typically involving a randomized

    /// ### Parameters
    /// * `rng`: A random number generator, required for signature schemes that use
    ///   probabilistic components.
    /// * `sk`: A reference to the secret key to be used for signing.
    /// * `epoch`: The specific epoch for which the signature is being created.
    /// * `message`: A fixed-size byte array representing the message to be signed.
    ///
    /// ### Returns
    /// A `Result` which is:
    /// * `Ok(Self::Signature)` on success, containing the generated signature.
    /// * `Err(SigningError)` on failure, for instance, if the probabilistic
    ///   encoding step fails to produce a valid codeword within the allowed attempts.
